        "abstract": "Background Temperature is a frequently used parameter to describe the predicted size of lesions computed by computational models. In many cases, however, temperature correlates poorly with lesion size. Although many studies have been conducted to characterize the relationship between time-temperature exposure of tissue heating to cell damage, to date these relationships have not been employed in a finite element model. Methods We present an axisymmetric two-dimensional finite element model that calculates cell damage in tissues and compare lesion sizes using common tissue damage and iso-temperature contour definitions. The model accounts for both temperature-dependent changes in the electrical conductivity of tissue as well as tissue damage-dependent changes in local tissue perfusion. The data is validated using excised porcine liver tissues. Results The data demonstrate the size of thermal lesions is grossly overestimated when calculated using traditional temperature isocontours of 42\u00b0C and 47\u00b0C. The computational model results predicted lesion dimensions that were within 5\\% of the experimental measurements. Conclusion When modeling radiofrequency ablation problems, temperature isotherms may not be representative of actual tissue damage patterns.",

        "abstract": "A challenging problem of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in liver surgery is to accurately estimate the shapes and sizes of RFA lesions whose formation depends on intrinsic variations of the thermal\u2013electrical properties of soft tissue. Large tumors, which can be as long as 10\u2009cm or more, further complicate the problem. In this paper, a probabilistic bio-heating finite element (FE) model is proposed and developed to predict RFA lesions. Uncertainties of RFA lesions are caused by the probabilistic nature of five thermal\u2013electrical liver properties: thermal conductivity, liver tissue density, specific heat, blood perfusion rate and electrical conductivity. Confidence levels of shapes and sizes of lesions are generated by the FE model incorporated with the mean-value first-order second-moment (MVFOSM) method. Based on the probabilistic FE method, a workflow of RFA planning is introduced to enable clinicians to preoperatively view the predicted RFA lesions in three-dimension (3D) within a hepatic environment. Accurate planning of the RFA needle placements can then be achieved based on the interactive simulation and confidence level selection.",

        "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the medial branch nerve is a widely used therapeutic intervention for facet joint pain. However, denervation of the multifidus muscle is an inevitable consequence of RFA. New ablation techniques with the potential to prevent muscle denervation can be designed using computational simulations. However, depending on the complexity of the model, they could be computationally expensive. As an alternative approach, deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to predict tissue temperature during RFA procedure. The objective of this paper is to predict the tissue spatial and temporal temperature distributions during RFA using DNNs. First, finite element (FE) models with a range of distances between the probes were run to obtain the temperature readings. The measured temperatures were then used to train the DNNs that predict the spatio-temporal temperature distribution within the tissue. Finally, a separate data obtained from FE simulations were used to test the efficacy of the network. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the network can achieve an error rate as low as 0.05\\%, accompanied by a 92\\% reduction in time compared to FE simulations. The approach proposed in this study will play a major role in the design of new RFA treatments for facet joint pain.",

An artificial tumour is placed inside the liver at the boundary. Simulations are carried out using the finite element method. The numerical results indicated that different electrical and thermal boundary conditions led to different predictions of the electrical potential, temperature and thermal coagulation distributions. Ground and body temperature conditions presented an unnatural physical conditions around the ablation site, which results in more intense Joule heating and excessive heat loss from the tissue. This led to thermal damage volumes that are smaller than the cases when the Robin type or the thermal insulation conditions are prescribed.

        "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique that is widely used to ablate solid tumors. Achieving precise personalized treatment requires feedback information on in situ thermal effects induced by RFA. Although computer simulations facilitate the prediction of electrical and thermal phenomena associated with RFA, their practical implementation in clinical settings is hindered by their high computational demands. In this paper, we propose a physics-guided radiofrequency ablation neural network (PhysRFANet) to enable real-time prediction of thermal effect during RFA treatment. Three networks, an encoder\u2013decoder based convolutional neural network (EDCNN), U-Net, and attention U-Net, designed for predicting the temperature distribution and the corresponding ablation lesion, were trained using biophysical computational models that integrated electrostatics, bioheat transfer, and cell necrosis, along with magnetic resonance (MR) images of breast cancer patients. The computational model was validated through experiments using ex vivo bovine liver tissue. Our model demonstrated a Dice score of 96.3\\% in predicting lesion volume and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.5624 for temperature distribution when tested with foreseen tumor images. Notably, even with unforeseen images, it achieved a Dice score of 93.8\\% for the ablation lesion and an RMSE of 0.7078 for the temperature distribution. All networks were capable of inferring results within 10 ms. The proposed technique, applied to optimize the placement of the electrode for a specific target region, holds significant promise for enhancing the safety and efficacy of RFA.",

        "abstract": "Thermal ablation is a widely applied electrosurgical process in medical treatment of soft biological tissues. Numerical modeling and simulations play an important role in prediction of temperature distribution and damage volume during the treatment planning stage of associated therapies. In this contribution we report a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical model, accounting for heat relaxation time, for more accurate and precise prediction of the temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the thermal ablation of biological tissues. Finite element solutions are obtained for most widely used percutaneous thermal ablative techniques, viz., radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Importantly, both tissue expansion and shrinkage have been considered for modeling the tissue deformation in the coupled model of high temperature thermal ablation. The coupled model takes into account the non-Fourier effects, considering both single-phase-lag (SPL) and dual-phase-lag (DPL) models of bio-heat transfer. The temperature-dependent electrical and thermal parameters, damage-dependent blood perfusion rate and phase change effect accounting for tissue vaporization have been accounted for obtaining more clinically relevant model. The proposed model predictions are found to be in good agreement against the temperature distribution and damage volume reported by previous experimental studies. The numerical simulation results revealed that the non-Fourier effects cause a decrease in the predicted temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the high temperature thermal ablative procedures. Furthermore, the effects of different magnitudes of phase lags of the heat flux and temperature gradient on the predicted treatment outcomes of the considered thermal ablative modalities are also quantified and discussed in detail.",

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases.

A total of 19 articles focused on simulating radiofrequency ablation (RFA) zones, and 16 focused on microwave ablation (MWA) zones. Out of the 16 articles simulating MWA, only 2 used in vivo experiments to validate their simulations. Out of the 19 articles simulating RFA, 10 articles used in vivo validation. Dice similarity coefficients describing the overlap between in vivo experiments and simulated RFA zones varied between 0.418 and 0.728, with mean surface deviations varying between 1.1 mm and 8.67 mm. CONCLUSION: Computational models to simulate ablation zones of MWA and RFA show considerable heterogeneity in model type and validation methods. It is currently unknown which model is most accurate and best suitable for use in clinical practice.",
